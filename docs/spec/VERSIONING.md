# VERSIONING

## Summary

This document defines the versioning and compatibility policy for the **Corpus Protocol Suite**—covering Graph, LLM, Vector, and Embedding components. It governs how we version **specifications**, **wire contracts (schemas/envelopes)**, **SDK libraries**, and **adapters**, ensuring predictable evolution and safe interoperability.

**Key tenets:**

- **Conformance‑driven compatibility** – A change is breaking **only if** it requires modifying an existing conformance test. Additive changes require only new tests; editorial changes require none.
- **SemVer for all artifacts** – MAJOR for breaking changes, MINOR for additive, PATCH for non‑behavioral fixes.
- **Wire compatibility within a MAJOR** – All clients and adapters speaking the same protocol major (e.g., `llm/v1.0`) must interoperate, regardless of SDK versions.
- **Backward/forward compatibility rules** – Unknown keys in open schemas are ignored; closed schemas reject them. Error taxonomy, observability, streaming, and scoring conventions all have explicit versioning semantics.
- **Deprecation lifecycle** – Features are announced, warned, and removed only after a minimum support window (≥ one MAJOR or 6 months).
- **Capability negotiation** – Adapters advertise supported protocol majors and feature flags; clients probe and gate accordingly.
- **Test‑first migration** – Every change is classified by its impact on conformance tests (add new vs. modify existing), and the release checklist enforces this.

This policy is authoritative for all Corpus Protocol Suite releases. It works in concert with [`SCHEMA.md`](./SCHEMA.md) (wire shapes) and [`PROTOCOL.md`](./PROTOCOL.md) (operation semantics).

## 0) Conformance‑Driven Compatibility Rule (Normative)

Corpus defines compatibility through its conformance suites. A release is considered compatible **if and only if**:

- All previously released conformance tests for the relevant protocol **MAJOR** continue to pass unchanged at 100%.

### 0.1 Breaking Change Definition

A change is **breaking** if achieving 100% conformance requires modifying, deleting, relaxing, or re‑baselining **any** previously released conformance test or its expected results for the same protocol MAJOR.

- **Breaking ⇒ MAJOR** bump for the affected normative artifact (schema / spec / protocol semantics).
- Breaking changes **MUST** be represented by releasing a new conformance suite version (e.g., `tests/v2.0.0`), and by incrementing the relevant protocol/spec MAJOR.

### 0.2 Additive Change Definition

A change is **additive (non‑breaking)** if it requires only:

- Adding **new** conformance tests (for new optional fields, new optional operations, new capabilities), **without modifying** any previously released tests, and all prior tests remain 100% passing.
- **Additive ⇒ MINOR** bump (or **PATCH** if purely editorial / non‑behavioral).

### 0.3 Editorial / Tooling‑Only Changes

Changes that do not alter required wire shapes or normative behavior (typos, clarifications, formatting, internal harness refactors) are **PATCH**, provided they do not change the meaning of any existing test expectation.

**Exception:** tests explicitly labeled `provider-variant` or `nondeterministic` may change expected ranges/allowlists without constituting a breaking protocol change, but those tests **MUST** be clearly marked as such and **MUST NOT** apply to wire format or normative semantics.

---

## 1) Goals

- **Predictability.** Consumers can upgrade with clear expectations about breakage risk and compatibility.
- **Interoperability.** Adapters and clients that share a protocol **MAJOR** must remain wire‑compatible.
- **Velocity with safety.** Additive changes flow under **MINOR/PATCH** without lockstep upgrades.
- **Auditability.** Every release is traceable to a changelog entry and migration path when needed.

---

## 2) What we version (at a glance)

| Thing | Example | Scheme | Compatibility Contract |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Protocol ID** (wire‑level major identifier, per component) | `llm/v1.0`, `vector/v1.0` | **Major‑stable identifier** | **Stable for the entire MAJOR**; does not change on MINOR/PATCH spec updates |
| **Protocol spec** (per component) | `protocols_version: 1.2` | **SemVer** (`MAJOR.MINOR[.PATCH]`) | Same‑**MAJOR** wire compatibility; **MINOR** strictly additive; **MAJOR** may break |
| **Wire envelopes / JSON schemas** | `schema_version: 1.0.3` | **SemVer** (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) | Adding optional fields = **MINOR**; changing/removing required fields or types = **MAJOR** |
| **SDK packages** (language libs) | `corpus-sdk-py 1.7.2` | **SemVer** | Public API stability aligned with spec **MAJOR**; SDK **MINOR/PATCH** must not break user code |
| **Adapters** (provider impls) | `corpus-adapter-qdrant 2.3.0` | **SemVer** | Adapter `MAJOR` may drop support for old protocol **MAJOR**; must advertise `protocol: <component>/v<major>.0` in `capabilities()` |
| **Spec repository snapshot** | Git tag `spec/v1.2.0` | **SemVer** tags | Tags track immutable snapshots for citations + conformance suites |

> **Key invariant:** If a client and adapter both speak `<component>/v1.0`, they must interoperate on the wire, regardless of SDK/package versions.

---

## 3) Semantic Versioning (how to decide MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH)

We follow **SemVer 2.0.0** for all artifacts.

### 3.1 Protocol & wire contracts (normative)

- **MAJOR** (`2.0.0`): Any **breaking** change in required fields, field types, error semantics, or operation signatures.  
  *Examples:* renaming or removing a required field; changing meaning of `score` from "higher is better" to the opposite; tightening validation that rejects previously valid requests.  
  **Per §0, this also includes any change that requires modifying, deleting, or re‑baselining an existing conformance test for the same protocol MAJOR.**
- **MINOR** (`1.2.0`): Any **additive** change.  
  *Examples:* new optional fields; new error subtype; new capability flag; new operation that is optional to implement.  
  **Additive changes are those that require only adding new conformance tests; all previously released tests remain unchanged and 100% passing.**
- **PATCH** (`1.1.3`): Editorial clarifications, typos, **non‑behavioral fixes**, and **test suite updates that do not change the normative contract** (e.g., fixing a harness bug, adding comments).  
  **However, updating an existing test’s expectation (even to reflect a more accurate non‑normative value) is NOT a PATCH unless the test is explicitly marked `provider-variant` or `nondeterministic` (see §0.3).**

### 3.2 SDK libraries & adapters (public API)

- **MAJOR:** Removing/renaming public classes/functions; changing parameter types; altering default behavior in a way that breaks existing apps.
- **MINOR:** Adding public functions/classes/flags; introducing optional parameters with safe defaults; performance improvements; new adapters.
- **PATCH:** Bug fixes, docs, build tooling, non‑breaking typing annotations.

---

## 4) Compatibility Matrix

**Within the same protocol MAJOR, wire compatibility is required.** Additive fields must be ignored **only where the schema explicitly permits extension**.

| Client Protocol | Adapter Protocol | Expectation |
|---|---|---|
| `v1.x` | `v1.y` | **Must** interoperate. Extension points are ignored as defined by schema. |
| `v1.x` | `v2.y` | **May fail**. Adapter SHOULD reject with `NotSupported` and include supported protocols in `error.details`. |
| `v2.x` | `v1.y` | **May fail**. Client should probe `capabilities()` and downgrade. |

### Negotiation rule (wire‑level, transport‑independent)

Clients MAY indicate desired protocol MAJOR via a transport mapping (e.g., HTTP header) or via the request envelope:

- Recommended: `ctx.attrs.accept_protocol = "<component>/v<major>.0"` (or equivalent)
- Request envelopes are open, so adding a hint field is allowed by the base request envelope schema.

If unsupported, adapter MUST return `NotSupported` and include:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "code": "NOT_SUPPORTED",
  "error": "NotSupported",
  "message": "Unsupported protocol requested",
  "retry_after_ms": null,
  "details": { "supported_protocols": ["llm/v1.0"] },
  "ms": 0.0
}
```

> **Note:** `capabilities.protocol` is a single value (const per schema). Supported protocol sets must be communicated via `error.details` (or via an explicitly versioned capabilities schema in a future MAJOR).

---

## 5) Backward/Forward Compatibility Rules (Normative)

### 5.1 Unknown JSON keys (schema‑governed)

- **Request envelopes:** Top‑level unknown keys MAY be present and MUST be ignored by adapters (request envelope is open).
- **ctx:** Unknown keys MUST be ignored by adapters (OperationContext is open).
- **args:** Unknown keys:
  - MUST be ignored only when the operation's args schema allows them (`additionalProperties: true`).
  - MUST be rejected (typically `BAD_REQUEST`) when the operation's args schema is closed (`additionalProperties: false`).
- **Success / Error / Streaming envelopes:** Closed by schema; unknown top‑level keys MUST be rejected by schema validation.

### 5.2 Error taxonomy changes

- Adding new error subtypes (and associated wire codes) is **MINOR** (additive).
- Renaming/removing existing error classes or changing retryability guidance is **MAJOR**.
- Error payload extensions must go in `details` (which is `object|null` and open by schema).

### 5.3 Observability

- Adding optional, low‑cardinality metric attributes is **MINOR/PATCH** depending on impact.
- Removing or reinterpreting a previously‑emitted attribute that downstream systems rely on is **MAJOR**.
- Privacy tightening (more redaction) is **MINOR**; loosening is **MAJOR**.

### 5.4 Streaming lifecycle

- Streaming success frames MUST remain `{ok, code:"STREAMING", ms, chunk}` with no extra top‑level keys (schema‑closed).
- Chunk schema changes follow SemVer rules:
  - Adding optional fields where allowed = **MINOR**
  - Removing/changing required fields = **MAJOR**

### 5.5 Vector scoring conventions

- The "higher is better" score convention is normative; changing it is **MAJOR**.
- If a backend provides only one of `score` or `distance`, adapters MUST synthesize the other (where schema requires both).

---

## 6) Deprecation Policy

We implement a standard deprecation lifecycle:

1. **Announce** in release notes and `CHANGELOG.md` with rationale + migration hints.
2. **Warn** where feasible (e.g., log a deprecation code in telemetry without leaking PII).
3. **Minimum support window:**
   - Keep deprecated features for at least one full **MAJOR** after announcement, or **6 months**, whichever is longer, unless there is a security issue.
4. **Removal** occurs at the next **MAJOR** release.

On the wire: mark deprecated fields with `"deprecated": true` in published JSON Schema (when applicable) and continue accepting them until removal in the next MAJOR.

---

## 7) Release Process & Tagging

### 7.1 Git tags

- **Spec changes:** `spec/vX.Y.Z` (repo snapshot)
- **Optional component tags:** `spec/<component>/vX.Y.Z` (when component‑specific release notes are maintained)
- **SDKs:** `<lang>/vX.Y.Z` (e.g., `python/v1.7.2`)
- **Adapters:** `adapter-<name>/vX.Y.Z` (e.g., `adapter-qdrant/v2.3.0`)

### 7.2 Branches

- **main:** active development (next MINOR)
- **release/vX.Y:** stabilization branch for imminent release
- **maint/vX.Y:** maintenance branch for backports to an older MINOR

### 7.3 Artifacts

- Every release updates `CHANGELOG.md` (format: Added/Changed/Fixed/Deprecated/Removed/Security).
- **If wire/spec touched:**
  - **Additive change:** update conformance suites by **adding new tests** (old tests remain untouched).
  - **Breaking change:** release a new conformance suite version (e.g., `tests/v2.0.0`) and update the relevant protocol/spec MAJOR.
  - Publish updated schema bundle.
- If schemas touched: bump `schema_version` and publish under a stable path.

---

## 8) Pre‑Releases, RCs, and Experimental Features

- **Pre‑releases:** `v1.2.0-rc.1`, `v1.2.0-beta.2`. No long‑term compatibility guarantees; APIs may change before General Availability (GA).
- **Experimental flags (code):** opt‑in via explicit environment variable or constructor parameter; default off.
- **Experimental capabilities (wire):** expose under explicit vendor/extension namespaces (e.g., `x-` prefixed keys) and do not rely on them for cross‑vendor compatibility.

Example progression:
> v1.2.0-beta.2 → v1.2.0-rc.1 → v1.2.0 (GA)

---

## 9) Long‑Term Support (LTS)

- Certain **MINOR** lines may be designated as LTS (e.g., `1.4.x`) supporting **12 months** of security and critical fixes.
- LTS backports must **not** change public APIs; no new features.
- LTS releases are **PATCH** increments only.

---

## 10) Multi‑Language Package Versioning

To reduce cross‑language drift:

- **Source of truth:** spec tags (`spec/vX.Y.Z`) and schema bundle versions (`schema_version`).
- SDKs must include a machine‑readable mapping (e.g., `sdk_support.json`) indicating supported protocol majors:

```json
{
  "llm": "v1.0",
  "vector": "v1.0",
  "graph": "v1.0",
  "embedding": "v1.0"
}
```

**Language‑specific notes:**

- **Go:** Module path remains stable across MINOR/PATCH; MAJOR increments add `/v2` per Go module rules.
- **Python:** `__version__` follows SemVer; publish wheels with parity; pin protocol compatibility in package metadata.
- **TypeScript/Java:** publish with SemVer; keep generated types in lockstep with schema bundles.

---

## 11) Capability Gating & Negotiation

Adapters **MUST** return `capabilities()` with:

- `protocol: "<component>/v<major>.0"` (schema const),
- feature flags (e.g., `supports_deadline`),
- limits (e.g., `max_top_k`, `max_dimensions`),
- vendor extensions only where schema allows (e.g., open capabilities schemas).

Clients **SHOULD**:

- probe `capabilities()` at startup,
- gate optional features based on flags,
- avoid assuming presence of non‑advertised fields.

Adding a new capability flag is **MINOR**. Removing or inverting its semantics is **MAJOR**.

---

## 12) Migration Checklist (for maintainers)

Before merging a change that affects public API/spec:

1. **Classify:** breaking vs additive vs editorial (refer to §0).
2. **Bump:** version(s) in spec/schemas/SDKs/adapters accordingly.
3. **Negotiate:** ensure fallback behavior or capability flag for optional features.
4. **Docs:** update `CHANGELOG.md` and any migration notes.
5. **Tests:** extend conformance tests.
   - **Breaking** → **modify or re‑baseline existing tests** (and release new conformance suite version).
   - **Additive** → **add new tests**; leave all existing tests untouched.
   - **Editorial/PATCH** → no test changes, or only changes to non‑normative test comments/harness.
6. **Deprecation:** mark deprecated and document timeline if applicable.
7. **Security/Privacy:** reconfirm SIEM‑safe invariants.

---

## 13) Examples

### 13.1 Add a new optional match attribute (Vector)

- **Change:** add `normalized_score` to `VectorMatch` only if the VectorMatch schema permits additional properties (or via a schema MINOR that adds an optional field).
- **Version:** **MINOR**.
- **Behavior:** Adapters may populate; clients not expecting it ignore the field (only if schema allows).
- **Test impact:** Add new conformance tests for `normalized_score`; existing tests unchanged.

### 13.2 Tighten error retryability (LLM)

- **Change:** classify an error from retryable → non‑retryable.
- **Version:** **MAJOR** (changes client behavior).
- **Migration:** document new handling; optionally add a transitional capability flag if both behaviors exist temporarily.
- **Test impact:** Modify existing conformance tests that expected retryable behavior; release new conformance suite version.

### 13.3 Add `supports_deadline` to capabilities (Embedding)

- **Change:** capability flag addition.
- **Version:** **MINOR**.
- **Behavior:** Adapters not supporting deadlines keep flag false; clients must check before using.
- **Test impact:** Add new conformance tests for deadline‑related behavior; existing tests unchanged.

---

## 14) Versioning for Documentation & Examples

- Examples are non‑normative unless explicitly marked.
- Example updates are typically **PATCH** unless they demonstrate new normative behavior (which must be versioned accordingly).
- Conformance suites track coverage deltas per protocol/spec version.

---

## 15) Security, CVEs, and Backports

- Security fixes may be backported to supported LTS lines and latest stable MINOR.
- If a security fix changes normative behavior:
  - Prefer an opt‑in flag defaulting to safe behavior, or
  - ship as **PATCH** with explicit release notes if the change is clearly in‑scope for safety.
- Publish advisories with fixed versions and upgrade guidance.

---

## 16) Notices & Legal

- `NOTICE` and license headers are maintained per Apache 2.0.
- Version tags and changelogs must not include vendor confidential material.

---

## 17) FAQ

**Q: Can an SDK 1.9.0 support protocol vector/v2?**  
A: Only if it explicitly advertises support (e.g., via `sdk_support.json`) and negotiates the requested protocol major. Otherwise, expect `NotSupported`.

**Q: Are additive validation checks breaking?**  
A: If they reject previously valid inputs, yes → **MAJOR**. If they only reject previously undefined/invalid inputs, it's **PATCH/MINOR** (document rationale).

**Q: Can we add a new error hint (e.g., `suggested_batch_reduction`)?**  
A: **MINOR** additive; put it in `error.details` and require clients to ignore unknown hints.

**Q: What if I need to fix a bug in a conformance test that changes expected output but doesn’t affect wire behavior?**  
A: If the test is marked `provider-variant` or `nondeterministic`, it may be adjusted without a breaking change (see §0.3). Otherwise, changing an existing test’s expectation constitutes a **breaking change** and requires a MAJOR bump.
